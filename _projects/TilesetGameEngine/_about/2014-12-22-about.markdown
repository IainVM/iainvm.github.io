This project I aim to make a simple Tileset Game Engine like old games such as Legend of Zelda using Java, and [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/). This will introduce OpenGL, which is contained inside LWJGL, to me and also be test my ability to effieciently program game mechanics. 

Targets: <br>
- Read Map Info from File <br>
- Render Map Info with given TileSet <br>
- Create Camera to move around the Map <br>
- Use multiple Map Layers <br>
- Have movable tile to represent the player <br>
- Have tiles that the player can't pass through (implement collisions) <br>
- Implement event tiles which trigger changing of maps<br>
- Implement animated tiles <br>
- Implement Enviromental effects (Day, Night, Snow) <br>
- Give Player Health, Inventory<br>
- Make items which render in world<br>
- Have player pick up items<br>
