Well everything has to start somewhere, and this is the start for my 
portfolio. I am currently hosting it on my 
[Github](https://github.com/IainVM) this may stay as it is, or I might 
move it to a personal server if I end up needing some extra usability I 
can't get from Github.

The Portfolio itself is hopefully going to be used to update anyone who 
visits on any personal projects I undertake, describe the projects, show 
the planning of them, and also explain how I tackled any problems I came 
across. This will help anyone reading, and myself, if anyone happens to 
be facing the same tasks I was.
