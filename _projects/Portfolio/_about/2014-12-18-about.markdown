This Porfolio is designed to host my personal projects, the planning that went into them, and the problems I ran into during these projects. 

The Portfolio uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), since it is focused around generating a simple infrastucture for blog centric websites. Meaning I can make make projects with separate blog updates on each.
